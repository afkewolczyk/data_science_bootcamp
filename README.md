# Data Science Bootcamp 

Out of interest, my practice code from the coding bootcamp: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/

The format of most files is jupyter notebooks, and uses Mini Conda. 

Some skills include: Python, pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow, Scikit Learn
